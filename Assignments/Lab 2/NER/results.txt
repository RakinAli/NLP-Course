For Minibatch:

True Positive = 13273
False Positives = 2015
False Negatives = 4036


Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 13273 / (13273 + 2015) = 0.868

Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 13273 / (13273 + 4036) = 0.767

F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.868 * 0.767) / (0.868 + 0.767) = 0.814

Since I have a convergence margin of 0.01, I will stop the training when the F1 score is greater than 0.814. This is why all of my models have the exact same answer.
